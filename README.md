# Academic Trends
Every week, we have seminars on **academic frontiers** and **industry trends**. This repository is used to record slides from presentations given by each person. 

## Pull Rule 
For ease of document management, please follow the upload rules as below: 
1. For each submission, you shall upload a file containing all resources in the presentation. The uploaded file should be an *encrypted* PDF named with your name. 
2. If your presentation contains video displaying, we suggest you put the online video URL in the PDF instead of uploading it.
